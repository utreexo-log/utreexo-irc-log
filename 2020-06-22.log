[16:58:00] <adiabat> Hey normally the weekly call is at 9:30 am EDT but this week how about 3 hours later, at 12:30PM EDT
[16:58:33] <adiabat> That's harder for people in KST but I think kcalvinalvin you're doing exams and stuff this week so not really working on this much?
[17:00:20] <ja> oooh, i will definitely join in then :)
[17:00:25] <adiabat> Aaron wants to join and he's on US pacific time so that fits better... and it's still OK for europe, and mayyybe KST could still work as it's like 1:30 am
[17:00:28] <adiabat> ok cool

[17:28:04] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat Yeah I'm not doing much at the moment. My focus will be back on Utreexo starting this Saturday.
[17:28:27] <kcalvinalvin> Yeah you guys could go ahead with that. Might hop on if I'm not asleep
[17:30:15] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: no no problem, exams and stuff
[17:30:29] <adiabat> I also haven't been doing as much, there are like, DCI meetings and things
[17:31:17] <adiabat> aaronc2347: welcome to IRC!  The communications protocol of the 80s... today.
[17:31:19] <kcalvinalvin> Was planning to say this at the call tomorrow but since I might not be on, I guess I could just say it here.
[17:31:39] *** Quits: ThomasV (~thomasv@unaffiliated/thomasv) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[17:31:47] <kcalvinalvin> The same guy that runs mempool.space might be up for running a bridgenode once we're ready to go
[17:32:06] <adiabat> fun, yeah I don't think there will be a shortage but great
[17:32:06] <kcalvinalvin> Haven't really filled him on the details since I don't know it yet either :)
[17:32:35] <adiabat> it's not any harder than running an archive node now, which is... not hard
[17:32:48] <adiabat> although I guess it's huge?
[17:32:54] <adiabat> hmm should test that
[17:33:01] <kcalvinalvin> Wouldn't it be a hassle bandwidth wise?
[17:33:03] <adiabat> full genproofs size for mainnet
[17:33:17] <adiabat> bandwidth is only an issue if everyone's downloading from you
[17:33:31] <kcalvinalvin> Assuming a bunch of people just start to play around with little nodes
[17:33:39] <adiabat> yeah could get annoying maybe
[17:33:57] <adiabat> I have a bitcoin mainnet node that's archive and has been running forever
[17:34:04] <adiabat> it's about 1 TB a month
[17:34:27] <adiabat> (all upload, like 100GB month down)
[17:35:27] <adiabat> I bet with erlay the download would get cut in half
[17:35:29] <kcalvinalvin> Eh maybe we would spin up some AWS lightsail nodes if it *really* starts to become a problem
[17:35:38] <kcalvinalvin> Or maybe that's not a problem but a really good thing :)
[17:35:44] <adiabat> doesn't AWS charge insane upload fees?
[17:35:56] <kcalvinalvin> oh right.. :/
[17:36:11] <adiabat> I have MIT servers... one of which is dead but
[17:36:21] <adiabat> I think soon I'll be able to go back there and fix it
[17:36:26] <adiabat> like in the next few weeks
[17:36:47] <adiabat> I guess we need to distinguish better...
[17:36:49] <kcalvinalvin> Well, I can spin up a server here (my ISP doesn't have a bandwidth cap) and seems like a Japan server is doable so...
[17:36:57] <adiabat> there's the proof archive, and then the bridge itself
[17:37:24] <adiabat> the archive is pretty big, actually we haven't measured it have we?
[17:37:31] <adiabat> maybe 500GB?
[17:37:34] <kcalvinalvin> Not for full mainnet no
[17:37:43] <kcalvinalvin> Prob around that much
[17:37:44] <adiabat> well 300GB for regular blocks
[17:37:51] <adiabat> and then an extra 200 or something
[17:38:06] <adiabat> there are wasy to reduce that, potentially by a lot
[17:38:26] <adiabat> but yeah an "archive" utreexo node will be big
[17:38:32] <kcalvinalvin> oh boy the sync speeds on hdds would be terrible :/ Maybe this is a good time to benchmark those as well
[17:38:47] <adiabat> a "bridge-only" is just the forest, which is 4GB or so
[17:39:00] <adiabat> wait, why would sync on HDD be bad?
[17:39:14] <kcalvinalvin> For a full bridgenode with all the proofs
[17:39:27] <adiabat> I don't think it'll be that bad
[17:39:34] <adiabat> but yeah we haven't tested it
[17:39:55] <adiabat> I bet you can do full mainnet genproofs on an HDD in under a day
[17:40:01] <adiabat> hm.  actually I don't know. heh
[17:40:23] <adiabat> but genproofs doesn't really *do* anything, like it doesn't know what anything is, there's no signature checking etc
[17:40:37] <adiabat> so it shouldn't be too slow.
[17:41:13] <kcalvinalvin> Ah right. Yeah but we should definitely start benchmarking
