[01:31:12] <adiabat> hm nope never mind it's non-deterministic.
[01:31:40] <adiabat> so it's nothing in the block.  probably some TCP code that hangs up then stops once the buffer is done
[01:37:13] <adiabat> oh man this PR... so many weird bugs.  I don't think I'm very good at network code
[01:37:43] <adiabat> it's some non-deterministic network deserialization thing... sometimes it gets to block 800...
[02:15:31] <adiabat> ... and if I put in printfs to see what's going wrong, it fixed the problem.  seriously.
[02:15:57] <adiabat> but only because it's slowing it down a lot 
[02:16:17] <adiabat> TCP means all the bytes get there in order, right?  And nothing gets dropped..?
[02:39:34] <adiabat> haha now I took the printfs out and the bug isn't showing up anymore...
[02:54:32] <adiabat> ok.  Bet I know how to fix this.
[02:54:49] <adiabat> In btcd, they never have an io.reader r and call r.Read().  Ever.
[02:55:05] <adiabat> they use io.ReadFull(r, dest)
[02:55:35] <adiabat> so... clearly r.Read(dest) doesn't work and io.ReadFull(r, dest) works.  because it reads the whole thing instead of part.
[02:56:10] <adiabat> gotta find everywhere I say r.Read and change it.  bet that fixes it.
[03:01:06] <adiabat> yup that was it.  sigh.
[03:07:23] <ja> nice, congrats :)
[03:14:03] <adiabat> well now there's some other bug at height 4110
[03:14:17] <adiabat> which is the first really big block that's 999238 bytes
[03:14:31] <adiabat> so... testnet3 is good for testing because mainnet doesn't have a block like that for years

[12:45:06] <kcalvinalvin> Some might say it's for testing
[12:47:32] <kcalvinalvin> Are we on at the same time
[12:55:53] <adiabat> yeah 9:00
[12:56:01] <adiabat> which is like ... in 5 min
[12:56:24] <adiabat> can't do an hour though, have to leave a bit earlier today
[12:56:31] <adiabat> also next week there are time changes I think
[12:56:40] <adiabat> but yeah I'll go on jitsi in a couple min
[14:16:05] <dergoegge> i missed the meeting because DST hasnt ended in the usa yet but in europe it has
[14:20:26] <dergoegge> i was mostly working on the C++ stuff last week: https://github.com/dergoegge/libutreexo
[14:23:30] <dergoegge> kcalvinalvin: i am using coc and clangd with vim for c++ and so far i am happy with it
[14:24:04] <dergoegge> gives me auto completion and compiler errors/warnings
