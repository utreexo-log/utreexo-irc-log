[02:00:58] <kcalvinalvin> ja Well, there is how bitcoind does it in that there are rev files
[02:01:55] <kcalvinalvin> I think that's actually better since you don't really expect reorgs of thousands of blocks
[02:02:07] <kcalvinalvin> And if there are reorgs of thousands of blocks, we got more things to worry about

[16:23:41] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: I think btcd is smaller overall
[16:23:47] <adiabat> or that's what I saw for testnet
[16:30:51] <adiabat> dergoegge: oh huh there is blocksonly, not much code there too.  So yeah could make sense to try to get a utreexo db working with blocksonly
[17:07:28] <adiabat> also the other thing about re-orgs... I actually think most of the rev files are useless, even in current bitcoin core
[17:07:52] <adiabat> and I don't mean useless as in "there's no way you can reorg 8 years so it won't happen"
[17:08:17] <adiabat> I mean that even if you try to make a 400,000 block, 200GB reorg, like in regtest or something...
[17:08:30] <adiabat> it won't work and bitcoind just crashes; basically it goes oom
[17:09:59] <adiabat> at least that's what i've heard from some people.  and it makes sense, nobody would bother to fix that since it never happens

[22:20:27] <dergoegge> adiabat: just did some testing with the latest master and #177. ibd is waaay slower, because the server spends all its time fetching the ttls from the db. so maybe hold of merging and i will add the things you mentioned in the comments https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/pull/177#issuecomment-667567339

[22:49:26] <adiabat> dergoegge: OK, makes sense.  Yeah having a db lookup for every utxo when you're serving it will be slow
[22:50:14] <adiabat> we can put them in the proof data and then remove from levelDB, shouldn't be too bad, and then the ttl DB stays small
