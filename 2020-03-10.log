[12:52:26] <adiabat> Hi - The time changed here so it's almost 9 now -- I can do a jitsi call at like 9:30 so in 40 min
[13:10:15] <kcalvinalvin> urm sure
[13:11:21] <kcalvinalvin> Daylight savings ended right?
[13:11:30] <kcalvinalvin> Or did it start..?
[13:14:56] <adiabat> it started, so now it's EDT here instead of EST
[13:15:07] <adiabat> the "S" being weird since it's like 30% of the year...
[13:16:41] <kcalvinalvin> Damn Benjamin Franklin

[13:32:04] <kcalvinalvin> I wanna talk about CSN tx validation. Forest is almost there but I'm just not sure how I'd go about it
[13:42:54] <kcalvinalvin> I'm on jitsi
