[10:08:28] <dergoegge> kcalvinalvin: 1.14.3
[13:45:33] <adiabat> huh go1.10.4 on this computer, guess I didn't upgrade this one.  The other was 1.11 so I could do the modules thing...
[13:45:59] <adiabat> but I guess without the modules thing is still works now since the rjected btcd and the regular one both have the same stuff now
[13:52:29] <adiabat> I need to upgrade, like, evvvverything.  On lubuntu 18.04 and lubuntu like doesn't even exist anymore, at least lxde doesn't
[13:57:02] <adiabat> hm should probably get a new computer if I'm going to re-install the OS.  This CPU is from 2012... maybe they've made things a bit faster since then
