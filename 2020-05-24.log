[18:10:08] <dergoegge> hey guys! i am computer science student from Berlin and i would like to contribute some more to utreexo. any pointers on what i should work on?
[18:41:12] <ja> dergoegge: IMHO some more comments in the algorithms would be nice
[18:42:00] <ja> dergoegge: people seems to want a script interpreter to enable full-node equivalent security, the others can talk to you about that
[18:42:33] <ja> dergoegge: maybe check out if kcalvinalvin has some branches to see what he is working on

[19:55:12] <ja> dergoegge: did you see my problem with dedupeSwapDirt ? maybe you can confirm the bug or tell me if i am wrong
[19:59:34] <ja> dergoegge: ah, calvin just sent a new PR
[23:09:21] <dergoegge> ja: can confirm thats either a bug or the documentation of dedupeSwapDirt is inaccurate. 
[23:14:30] <ja> thanks. i think it is most likely a bug, would be weird to write the docs if there were such a weird edge case. probably an off-by-one
[23:15:00] <ja> would be awesome if it could explain the problems people have been having syncing testnet
[23:15:59] <dergoegge> ja: should i look into fixing it or do you want to do that?
[23:16:36] <ja> dergoegge: i think it would be a great first issue, so if you want, please go ahead!
[23:17:19] <dergoegge> ja: ok great
