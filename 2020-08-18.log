[12:43:30] <adiabat> Hi - this week is later call, but can do at 11:30am EDT if that works. 
[12:43:58] <adiabat> Also not much to cover, I only had a little time to code this past week, so maybe a quick meeting
[12:44:15] * fanquake doesn't think he'll make it to 11:30pm
[12:44:28] <fanquake> All good though, if there's not much to discuss
[12:44:39] <adiabat> yeah I was mostly doing meetings and stuff
[12:44:51] <fanquake> #exciting
[12:44:51] <adiabat> we announced the whole fed thing though so that's mostly done with :)
[12:45:11] <adiabat> next step: utreexo into central bank digital currency
[12:45:15] <fanquake> ðŸš€
[12:45:41] <adiabat> Hmmm not sure about rocket / moon though since CBDCs can't really go up or down in price :)
[12:46:13] <fanquake> heh. I'll have to trade in the rocket emoji for something more appropriate
[12:46:28] <fanquake> ðŸ”®
[13:03:23] <dergoegge> adiabat: i came up with an idea for the cache simulation we talked about last time. haven't tested it yet but if you want to look at that before the meeting: https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/blob/69b63564720bccd31e5aa8d09a050aa092880475/accumulator/pollardproof.go#L117
[13:03:47] <dergoegge> 11:30 works for me
[14:16:35] <kcalvinalvin> 11:30 is good
[14:16:42] <kcalvinalvin> is that in 14 minutes?
[14:17:40] <fanquake> In 1 hour and 13 minutes
