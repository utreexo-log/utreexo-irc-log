[07:31:17] <kcalvinalvin> So... about FullPollard... You'd want to stop and resume this
[07:32:03] <kcalvinalvin> Not much clean ways to do this without leveldb I think
[07:32:17] <kcalvinalvin> I guess Pollard in general unless you don't want to cache

[13:44:43] <adiabat> yeah for full pollard realistically you'll need to flush to disk / restore from disk
[13:44:57] <adiabat> though can test it out without that & see if it's slower or faster
[13:45:15] <adiabat> also it'd be really cool to have full pollard *on* disk, the way we can with forest
[13:46:02] <adiabat> but... I don't know a good way to do that.  There's gotta be one, seems like a general CS-y problem people have probably figured out cool algorithms for
[13:46:28] <adiabat> also - can't do a 9am call, more like 9:30, is that OK?
[13:55:40] <adiabat> alternatively, could do tomorrow at 9am if that's better for you
[14:00:52] <kcalvinalvin> sure
[14:11:54] <adiabat> which is better?
[14:19:20] <kcalvinalvin> the call time? Either is fine
[14:20:31] <adiabat> ok let's do tomorrow at 9, should have more time then
[14:21:03] <kcalvinalvin> oh I missed one of the messages :/
[14:21:18] <kcalvinalvin> Is a quick call in 9 mins good?
[14:21:41] <kcalvinalvin> some things I want to talk about for a general direction for full pollard 
[14:33:34] <adiabat> oh
[14:33:43] <adiabat> ok how about quick call in like... 15 min?
[14:34:02] <adiabat> will message in a bit when I get set up
[14:34:32] <kcalvinalvin> cool. Just like ~15 minutes fine for you?
[14:53:14] <adiabat> hey I'm online now
[14:53:19] <adiabat> meet.jit.si/utreexo
[15:31:13] <kcalvinalvin> ok cool so I'll let you test out the FullPollard thing since I think it'll take me at least a few days to gronk the code
[15:32:16] <kcalvinalvin> If you push the uint to int stuff with genproofs.go, I'll take those and resume work with trying to get a driver working on btcd
