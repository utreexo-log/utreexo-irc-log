[03:03:12] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat I think there's some allocations that isn't necessary. I'll try removing those today

[18:16:04] <kcalvinalvin> It's probably since I've only synced til 2014 but btcd is taking 82% of the time on gc and db (~40% on gc and ~40% on db)
[18:16:59] <kcalvinalvin> Seems like utreexo thrown in there would help *a lot*
[18:21:32] <ja> kcalvinalvin: how do you measure time spent in gc?
[18:24:59] <rjected> kcalvinalvin: it's not because you've only synced till 2014, gc is crazy in btcd
[18:25:20] <rjected> well maybe it is, depending on what you were expecting
[18:25:43] <rjected> utreexo would help a ton

[21:42:03] <adiabat> well... that seems like the next step then, shove utreexo into btcd
[21:42:15] <adiabat> I actually don't think it'd be *that* hard
[21:42:35] <adiabat> I mean fairly hard but not crazy
[21:43:02] <adiabat> also now I have a server
[21:46:04] <adiabat> there was a bunch of google cloud credits.  I spent like 2 hours just trying to figure out how to get ssh keys to work
[21:46:30] <adiabat> anyway it's 35.188.186.244
[21:47:04] <adiabat> I could give it a hostname I guess. bridgenode.tadge.net? or .lit3.co?  I have some random domains
[21:49:16] <adiabat> I will try to have a bridge node of current master up and running on there, most of the time
[21:49:55] <adiabat> also I guess if anyone wants I can put their ssh keys on it.  Or if you have your own servers you can do the same 
[21:50:03] <adiabat> and we can have a binary randomly choose from a list
[21:50:25] <adiabat> also I'm writing up some road map stuff and... I think we should have a quick "release" soon / now ish
[21:50:30] <adiabat> just to get some interest
[21:50:57] <adiabat> but then it's a bit weird because it seems like right after the release we switch to getting utreexo into btcd
[21:51:31] <adiabat> which doesn't actually throw away too much code, but 'utreexoserver' and 'utreexoclient' would likely not make it

[23:23:42] <adiabat> also, getting a "panic: varint is 7" at the end of genproofs
[23:26:23] <adiabat> maybe should do this on github... but yeah why does rev.go #247 have that error?
[23:26:37] <adiabat> if varint != 0, return error
[23:26:56] <adiabat> then the next line is ti.Varint = varint... which must always be 0 at that point
[23:27:29] <adiabat> so why even have that field if it's always 0?
[23:27:46] <adiabat> anyway I'm going to take out the !=0 check there and see if everything still works fine
[23:29:46] <adiabat> also ti.Height is always non-zero right?
[23:30:00] <adiabat> since you can't spend anything from height 0
