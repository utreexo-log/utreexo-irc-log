[04:20:10] <zanuck1> I would like to add utreexo to a bitcoin fork, how do I go about starting?
[04:21:42] <zanuck1> I was thinking of just adding it to the actual core
[04:38:42] <ja> zanuck1: i don't know if altcoins are on-topic for this channel but since the current codebase is based on btcd, maybe look at how ltcd works first, then port those onto utcd

[06:57:39] <kcalvinalvin> bridgenode used up ~690GB up to block 550,000ish and crashed because it used up all my storage :/
[06:58:05] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat do you have 2tb servers for google cloud? heh

[14:20:00] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: I think I can allocate more disk on the servers.  Maybe it needs to be a new server, will look
[14:20:22] <adiabat> but yeah guessing roughly 2X the storage of a normal full node
[14:33:51] <adiabat> OK I increased the utcd disk size and bridge disk size
[14:34:59] <adiabat> though in both cases the disks were mostly empty; did you delete the proofs after I guess?
[16:11:01] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat dergoegge I've finished the new txscript package without the dumb gc in branch utreexo-saveworkonparsescript-1
[16:11:17] <kcalvinalvin> All the tests are passing now :) Might be a good time to benchmark
[16:11:48] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat Yeah should probably recommend 2tb disk if anyone wants to try running their own
[18:15:58] <adiabat> 1TB should do it right? currently 350GB for mainnet, plus another 350GB for proofs, to about 700GB all in
[18:16:31] <adiabat> hmm.  There are definitely a whole bunch of ways to reduce that 350GB of proofs, but... probably not worth it. 2X is a good overhead factor
[19:55:08] <kcalvinalvin> 1tb of free space should do it
[19:55:49] <kcalvinalvin> usually people have other stuff as well on their 1tb disk so...
[20:23:07] <dergoegge> Cool! Will do some benchmarking. Is the bridge already running?
