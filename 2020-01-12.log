[06:57:31] <kcalvinalvin> Hmmm yeah the new undo stuff is def slower... Seems 3 times slower for me
[06:57:47] <kcalvinalvin> I thought it was me and was wondering what I screwed up haha
[07:11:04] <kcalvinalvin> ok it's varing a lot between tests. I'm using memory based forest and sometimes it takes ~3min and sometimes it takes ~10min
[07:41:46] <kcalvinalvin> Should mention all the times are based off runing simcmd against blk00000.dat and blk00001.dat
[19:44:16] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: weird, 
[19:44:30] <adiabat> variance with ... just running it? doing stuff in the background?
[19:45:27] <adiabat> with ram-based, it shoudn't be much slower, so I'll have to look at that.  
[19:46:30] <adiabat> like 50% slower would make sense.  but not 3X.  I got rid of all the printfs anyway.  Also there's a pretty big cleanup / optimization left (get rid of floor transform)
