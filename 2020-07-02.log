[15:37:13] <kcalvinalvin> I managed to get 80% speedup in offsetfile generation :0
[15:37:16] <kcalvinalvin> PR soon :)
[15:37:33] <kcalvinalvin> just need to clean up the code

[18:48:13] <adiabat> 80% is pretty good :)
[18:48:48] <adiabat> is it like, goes from taking 10 seconds to 6 seconds
[18:48:55] <adiabat> or 10 seconds to 2 seconds
[18:49:06] <adiabat> I can see how both of those are "80%"
[18:50:12] <adiabat> well the first would be 10 to 5.555 not 6 but... anyway

[20:03:46] <kcalvinalvin> The github tests are failing since the binary names changed
[20:03:59] <kcalvinalvin> So csn_bridge.sh is failing
