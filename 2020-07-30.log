[02:15:38] <adiabat> I think it needs to be in combination with #176 to see a speedup.
[02:16:04] <adiabat> because it's still hashing all the way up to the root instead of stopping when it gets to a populated node
[02:16:20] <adiabat> also I need to test and merge all these things since they work together! :)

[22:41:15] <dergoegge> adiabat: could swaps on the bottom row be oneway moves instead? because why move the value of the leaf we want to forget anyway. i don't know if that would be worth it but maybe for the disk forest.
