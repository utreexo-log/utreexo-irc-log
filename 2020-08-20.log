[18:17:01] <dergoegge> i did some profiling on slices vs. maps and the amount of gc that is going on did not change. now either using slices doesn't improve anything (or my implementation is bad) or the maps aren't the problem. 
[18:17:52] <dergoegge> shouldn't most of the gc be done for the blocks and proofs that we through away?
[18:20:48] <dergoegge> also it looks like the gc never blocks anything. so is it even that bad?
[18:21:43] <dergoegge> *throw away

[21:52:10] <dergoegge> there is a lot of appending to slices going on, we should probably preallocate when possible.
