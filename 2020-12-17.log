[18:32:09] <dergoegge> i profiled on the test server for #229. turns out its not worth it to parallelize the hashing. there is a lot more hashing on mainnet but its still a very small % of the entire thing.
[21:08:17] <adiabat> huh... I guess that's bad in that it means it's slow, but good in that in means there should be plenty of speedups left
