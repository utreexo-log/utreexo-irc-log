[17:38:43] <kcalvinalvin> Ok so I knew this was gonna bite us eventually.. :/ but the heights are being called wrong and I think that's the problem
[17:40:22] <kcalvinalvin> Way back when everything was in text, parseblock would get everything from blk*.dat and every following binary was based off of that. So when you call the first line, it gave you the block #1 not block #0
[17:41:27] <kcalvinalvin> So to keep compatibility with that, I made the GetRawBlocksFromFile() ignore block 0. So when you pass 0 as the height value, it would give you block #1
[17:42:06] <kcalvinalvin> Right now in the latest master, we're calling GetRawBlocksFromFile() with 1 so it's giving us block #2
[17:43:00] <kcalvinalvin> So all the heights are messed up... I'll make a PR that has the GetRawBlocksFromFile() actually give you block #1 when you give it 1

[17:53:57] <ja> sounds good!
[20:20:22] <kcalvinalvin> #PR 120 adds the mentioned documentation. Ended up being cleaner since all the directories are already moved heh
[20:20:33] <kcalvinalvin> Rebasing...... was not fun
[20:20:49] <kcalvinalvin> until I realized I'm not changing much
[20:21:36] <kcalvinalvin> I'll push the changed I mentioned above later today/tomorrow

[22:47:15] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: I think I fixed the heights thing on friday?
[22:47:51] <adiabat> what I changed was:
[22:48:19] <adiabat> now when you make calls to GetRawBlocksFromFile() or the rev version, and ask for block 0, it will return an error
[22:49:05] <adiabat> but if you don't ask for block 0, it decrements the block height by one and gets that.  So asking for block 1 will give you byte offset 0
[22:49:47] <adiabat> This seems to work OK; the heights agree with the heights stored in rev block data.
[22:50:42] <adiabat> maybe there's a cleaner way to do it but I think the height problem is fixed
[22:50:51] <adiabat> it's in a9af95c65c7e54ace029a8992b316da501b325ff which is the most recent commit to master
[22:51:39] <adiabat> just don't want you to write another fix 
[22:52:13] <adiabat> (I mean you can if you don't like mine heh)
[22:52:23] <adiabat> (just wanted you to at least know about mine first)
