[09:00:14] <kcalvinalvin> Was there a change to some leveldb call? I'm experience really heavy slowdowns and pprof is telling me it's leveldb
[12:01:14] <stevenroose> I have this archaic UTreeXO call reminder since last year or so. do these calls still happen? I'm curious for an update, but otherwise I'm going to remove the reminder :)
[12:20:45] <fanquake> stevenroose: yea they do
[12:21:10] <fanquake> I think there's one in about 40 minutes tonight. Generally happen this day every week,
[12:59:22] <stevenroose> fanquake: yeah that's what I have in my calendar :) I don't have a link or anything, though
[13:01:24] <kcalvinalvin> stevenroose https://meet.jit.si/utreexo
[13:01:29] <fanquake> stevenroose: https://meet.jit.si/utreexo is the link. When adiabat is around he can confirm anything else
[13:02:11] <adiabat> hey yeah doing call now
