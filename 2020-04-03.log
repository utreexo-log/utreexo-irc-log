[03:36:13] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat I made a PR with the fix
[04:15:32] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: cool, looking at it
[04:15:41] <adiabat> seems like it works
[04:16:13] <adiabat> both the rev blocks *and* the regular blocks are off by 1 so it matches up :)
[04:16:34] <adiabat> also rev data exists for utxos that are created and destroyed in the same block
[04:17:04] <adiabat> which you don't need, but I guess it's easier; don't have to have any special code for that
[04:20:03] <adiabat> nice, yeah this looks like it works, so everything for the add / del / sig check is there
[04:20:25] <adiabat> should I merge?  ysangkok pointed out some comment inconsitencies
[04:20:58] <ysangkok> i think they are fixed already
[04:22:20] <adiabat> oh, yup they are
[04:22:23] <adiabat> ok cool merging
