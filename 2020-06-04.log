[15:34:25] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: do you have a levelDB lookup PR?  I can take that, or do the fingerprint based sortinf
[15:34:34] <adiabat> *sorting
[15:34:45] <kcalvinalvin> Haha nice timing
[15:34:54] <kcalvinalvin> I just figured it out
[15:35:05] <adiabat> ok cool I won't work on it then :)
[15:35:06] <kcalvinalvin> Just need to actually put it into rev stuff now
[15:35:27] <kcalvinalvin> It's weird though... I don't get the nVersion field with CBlockFileIndex
[15:35:52] <adiabat> doesn't block me because my files are luckily sorted the right way but for some people it's sortof blocking for genproofs I guess
[15:36:00] <adiabat> we don't need nVersion right?
[15:36:03] <kcalvinalvin> Every testnet block record gives me nVersion:  180100
[15:36:09] <kcalvinalvin> we don't but it's odd.
[15:36:17] <kcalvinalvin> Like... what's that 18 in the front?
[15:36:30] <kcalvinalvin> Everything else is correct so I know it's working
[15:39:42] <kcalvinalvin> Maybe I'm missing something... I'll get something by the end of the week though
[16:37:55] <adiabat> it's probably some weird ... endian / encoding thing?
[16:38:38] <adiabat> but yeah nVersion is pretty irrelevant, doesn't apply to utxos
[16:38:59] <adiabat> I guess it *could* have applied to utxos as a soft fork, and could technically in the future
[16:39:17] <adiabat> but since bitcoind's database now doesn't keep track of it, it's pretty much gone

[21:04:07] <adiabat> so.... should I switch utreexo's imports to rjected/btcd ...?  Been almost a week with no reponse to the PR
[21:04:45] <adiabat> maybe I really shouldn't complain because I am bad about missing PRs / issues and leaving them / forgetting about them and stuff
[21:05:06] <adiabat> but also maybe we should switch anyway if there's more btcd changes and experiments we want to try
