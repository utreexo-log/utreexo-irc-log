[06:25:25] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat ok I'll get started on messages
[06:38:32] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm seems like bitcoind does something similar. src/validation.cpp, line 2045, on master (specifically commit 31c9987976af8ac5ad40091256ac41a2ccb078cd)
[06:40:06] <kcalvinalvin> It does say the BIP30 checking is only done if BIP34 is not activated yet
[08:03:50] *** reallll is now known as belcher

[20:10:00] <adiabat> yeah the code is probably still there in both but never used since there's bip34
[20:12:32] <adiabat> I guess with btcd it's sortof surprising since btcd came out after bip34 was activated
[20:13:10] <adiabat> so it seems like there would never be any reason to use that code, since you could just rely on bip34 to ensure no duplicates
