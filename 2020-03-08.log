[02:56:14] <kcalvinalvin> ysangkok I tested it out and it works now on the newest master :)
[02:56:37] <kcalvinalvin> Works as in that the proof fails after deletion as it should
[03:27:28] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: why should that proof fail? the proof is not for the one being deleted

[06:27:09] <kcalvinalvin> ysangkok In the test that you wrote, we have a forest with two leaves and then delete one
[06:27:31] <kcalvinalvin> 02:ff55
[06:27:36] <kcalvinalvin> |-------\
[06:27:42] <kcalvinalvin> 00:0100 01:0200
[06:27:50] <kcalvinalvin> So this would be the original tree
[06:28:50] <kcalvinalvin> the proof for leaf 00 is itself and 01. We hash this and get ff55... which we then test against the 02 leaf
[06:28:58] <kcalvinalvin> They match so it verifies
[06:30:07] <kcalvinalvin> but if we delete leaf 0, the forest is now a single leaf, with it being the top and the sole tree in the whole forest
[06:30:32] <kcalvinalvin> the hash of this top is 0100 but the proof hash gives ff55
[06:30:35] <kcalvinalvin> they don't match so it fails
[06:38:14] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm I haven't thought about the wallet implications before for things like this. adiabat could chime in later I guess
[06:39:25] <kcalvinalvin> But could you add your test to blockproof_test.go
[06:39:37] <kcalvinalvin> I think it'd be good to have
[06:42:38] <kcalvinalvin> oh wait no haha if you prove something, you can delete it since the only time you prove in Bitcoin is when you spend
[06:43:01] <kcalvinalvin> The only time you would delete is after you prove. No wallet implications here
[06:54:19] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm on the other hand, this is an edge case that would never happen but technically that proof should work
[08:15:45] <kcalvinalvin> I guess with forest, a user can just make a new blockproof before submitting the proof. Doesn't take long and the proof is pretty small
[08:15:57] <kcalvinalvin> Not sure about pollard
[08:24:15] <kcalvinalvin> I think what pollard have to do is to manage the proof for your particular tx as new blocks (and their blockproofs) come in
[08:24:34] <kcalvinalvin> There's no code for that yet..
