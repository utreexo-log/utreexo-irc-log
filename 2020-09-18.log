[17:33:27] <adiabat> hm yeah I guess the "default server" should stay current with the release, not master?
[17:33:53] <adiabat> maybe the default hard-coded server should only even exist in a release, for master it's changing enough that we can't change the server
[17:34:34] <adiabat> don't want to worry about breaking backwards compatibility at this point
