[04:31:55] <adiabat> hmmm maybe not.  I'm also getting rid of sending the redundant target hashes which is a bit more complex
[04:32:27] <adiabat> that and hashing only to intersection with populated is... in retrospect maybe not the best as it's two semi overlapping things at once
[04:32:48] <adiabat> I think I can get compact serialization & omitting target hashes for now
