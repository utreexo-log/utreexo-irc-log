[14:48:38] <jamesob> Am traveling today and won't be able to make the meeting (as you can probably tell)
[16:11:54] <kcalvinalvin> jamesob oh cool so you're joining every week now?
[16:12:08] <kcalvinalvin> Should actually tell people on irc that we have meetings...
[16:12:30] <kcalvinalvin> Did that like months ago but I think Tadge eventually stopped cuz no one joined anyways
[18:16:57] <jamesob> kcalvinalvin: yeah I figure I'll at least show up and hang out to get a sense of what's going on
