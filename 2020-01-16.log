[06:01:51] <kiok46> The idea of utreexo fascinates me, you are going to see me here more often.
[06:10:46] <kiok46> You ever considered discord? Most of the orgs which I am part of or was part of shifted to discord.

[09:01:28] <kcalvinalvin> We've talked about moving to a different thing (maybe mattermost?)
[09:03:23] <kcalvinalvin> Discord doesn't really seem to fit the spirit of Bitcoin imo

[17:38:51] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: what's wrong with irc? it is historically used in bitcoin. i have been following your discussion without issues all this time.
[17:40:04] <ysangkok> i know the UX argument, but this is a super technical channel. what are odds that somebody is smart enough to develop utreexo but not smart enough to use irc?
[17:44:10] <ysangkok> you could also argue your values are reflected in your choice of slack/discord/irc. but i find it astounding that we are in a community where it is commonly agreed that you need to store a 200 GB blockchain to be safe, but apparently there is no problem giving up your infrastructure to some arbitrary third party because they have better UX.
