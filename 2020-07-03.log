[19:25:08] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat Originally I tested it on my chromebook with external ssd and it was 10 seconds to 2 seconds but only for user + system time
[19:25:14] <kcalvinalvin> clock time was like 30%
[19:26:03] <kcalvinalvin> Tested it on the macbook with the internal ssd and the wall clock is down like 80%
[19:26:17] <kcalvinalvin> I think your mileage varies on how fast your disk is
[19:27:26] <kcalvinalvin> I haven't put any concurrency here though. So it could go even faster but I'm not sure if it's worth the complexity/effort since it's fairly quick anyways..
