[03:02:50] <ysangkok> kanzure: no, i am talking about a workshop mentioned in the issues list on github. from the issue, it sounds like it is upcoming
[06:23:17] <kcalvinalvin> @ysangkok Ah that's the Utreexo workshop that's part of the DG labs 3 day Bitcoin Workshop
[06:23:25] <kcalvinalvin> Info in this link. https://t.co/m9enB2POzX?amp=1
[06:23:47] <kcalvinalvin> Utreexo will just be a single session there though
[06:28:02] <kcalvinalvin> ysangkok bc-2.jp also works and is safer I guess
