[04:19:50] <adiabat> just a note: utreexoserver is using 100% cpu (1 core) when serving to utreexoclient
[04:20:12] <adiabat> that... seems wrong, as all it's doing is grabbing a file off the disk and throwing it over the network
[04:20:24] <adiabat> which shouldn't take any cpu
[04:20:30] <adiabat> so... something to look at
[04:20:46] <adiabat> I will investigate tomorrow
