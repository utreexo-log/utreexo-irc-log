[13:19:59] <adiabat> hey utreexo dev call in ~10 min @ meet.jit.si/utreexo
[13:20:18] <adiabat> actually I might be a couple min late so say 9:35
[13:45:58] *** Joins: ThomasV (~thomasv@unaffiliated/thomasv)
[14:35:10] <rjected> ok adiabat/dergoegge/kcalvinalvin you're all invited to rjected/btcd
[14:35:35] <rjected> I can cherry pick the utxoview commit if you want?
[14:36:17] <adiabat> sure that works, then we could change imports and merge #135

[19:52:43] <dergoegge> should the accumulator panic? i mean it's not that important but its more go-like to have libs not panic but instead return errors.
[19:57:36] <dergoegge> also what would you guys think of a separate package for all this blk/rev/index file stuff?

[21:08:54] <rjected> Yeah I think in go panics are usually avoided in favor of errors unless the rest of the program can't run anyways due to the thing causing the panic
[21:53:05] <rjected> also we might wanna look at btcd/blockchain/fullblocktests if we want to easily test stuff like reorgs and whatnot
