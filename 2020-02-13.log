[09:33:13] <kcalvinalvin> Quick question that never came across my mind until now
[09:33:23] <kcalvinalvin> Would the witness also have a utreexo tree?
[09:33:34] <kcalvinalvin> I guess it would..?

[12:23:18] <adiabat> what's the witness?
[12:23:56] <adiabat> the signatures? like in segwit? no, only need to store utxos, the witnesses work the same as now
[15:59:24] <kcalvinalvin> ok cool
[16:57:07] *** rafalcpp_ is now known as rafalcpp
