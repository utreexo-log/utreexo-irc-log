[01:26:06] <ja> if we have the 16 leaf, 4 height tree (line 11 in printout.txt) and we delete leafs 4 through 9 inclusive
[01:26:09] <ja> we'll be calling makeSwaps([25,26],False,28) which is [(27,25)]
[01:26:12] <ja> now, looking at the tree, how does that makes sense?
[01:26:14] <ja> so makeSwaps knows that 25 and 26 are "newDels", and that 28 is the root (except it isn't actually the root of 26?!?). so it returns a swap from 27 to 25.
[01:27:32] <ja> i only understand that the function returns swaps that are not collapses; does somebody understand it better?

[02:03:38] <ja> aaah this is why i am confused: a leaf with simply leaves 1-16 added will not have height 5 like in the example on line 11. i thought it would, since the 15 leaf tree on line 21 has height 4.

[16:34:02] <ja> seems it is that hidden node issue calvin mentioned earlier. i don't how forestRows doesn't need to reflect that the tree is actually 5 tall in the case of 16 leaves. i mean, there are five nodes on the path from root to leaf, right? and there is only one root.
