[03:59:37] <adiabat> the height to blockhash isn't stored anywhere.  I think it's generated on startup and kept in ram
[03:59:49] <adiabat> (just read the headers)
[04:00:36] <adiabat> also... yeah there are a lot of testnet blocks.  We can also cut down header size, as it doesn't need to be 80 bytes
[04:00:46] <adiabat> prevHash can be eliminated, it's totally redundant
[04:01:14] <adiabat> "bits" is also redundant, only needs to be there once every 2016 blocks, etc
[04:01:24] <adiabat> I think you can get headers down by almost half
[04:02:02] <adiabat> I know other bitcoin people have talked about this but nobody's bothered because headers are dwarfed by everything else.
[04:02:19] <adiabat> but in our case, keeping headers around would be the biggest part

[09:14:14] <kcalvinalvin> there's also some btcd stuff that I can't easily get rid of
[09:14:23] <kcalvinalvin> Eh... have to just be fine for now
[09:14:35] <kcalvinalvin> And say that there's more that we can slim up

[16:27:04] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat on btcd, since it uses checkpoints and not assumevalid, it skips some of the checks that bitcoind would otherwise do
[16:27:17] <kcalvinalvin> Should I set it so that it does them? (This is trivial to change)

[21:13:49] <adiabat> wait btcd is still checkpoints, not assumevalid?  does it have more recent checkpoints than bitcoind?
