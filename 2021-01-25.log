[03:33:09] <adiabat> hey all - I can't do a call tomorrow morning so no 9am call
[03:34:04] <adiabat> Claire is joining as a UROP and is in pacific time for now so ... yeah there's no time that works for everyone, but maybe we can do 10 or 11 am EST to start?
[03:35:14] <adiabat> I think she will be in boston in a month or so, at which point we can go back to 9am EST; that isn't too late for the other side of the pacific
[05:35:15] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm so what time are you good adiabat
[05:35:25] <kcalvinalvin> have some stuff I'd like to talk about
[13:51:51] <adiabat> can we schedule a 10 or 11 am tomorrow?  also I'll ask claire.  And try to get her on IRC.  Hm maybe I could set up an IRC client on one of the google cloud servers...
[13:56:34] <dergoegge> both 10 or 11 would work for me
[14:01:10] <kcalvinalvin> yeah 10 or 11 works
[14:42:23] <kcalvinalvin> hmm there's a point where proof data overtakes block data in mainnet
[14:43:06] <kcalvinalvin> I'm on block ~570,000 and proof is 319G while block is 259G
