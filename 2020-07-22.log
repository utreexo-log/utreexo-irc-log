[02:00:26] <adiabat> hmmm I don't know if I can do backwards tonight
[02:00:31] <adiabat> there's a bunch of things that need to change
[11:49:25] <kcalvinalvin> I think there is real value to maybe trying out github.com/minio/sha256-simd
[11:49:54] <kcalvinalvin> I'll make a PR but the accumulator is so much faster with it

[13:59:46] <adiabat> cool
[13:59:55] <adiabat> Ok there's "release" 0.1 up
[14:00:05] <adiabat> and already people are attacking the server heh
[14:00:54] <adiabat> hopefull the go network code can tolerate random things connecting to the utreexoserver port and trying to buffer overflow it
[14:12:23] <dergoegge> just check in with the server every now and then to make sure its still running :D
[14:14:38] <adiabat> oh now have the first actual user
[14:14:45] <adiabat> hm maybe should have better server logs
[14:15:10] <adiabat> first non attacker user was vodafone-ip.de
[14:15:31] <dergoegge> that was probably me i wanted to see if it is running

[14:55:34] <adiabat> hah OK well then there don't seem to have been any real users yet then
[14:56:37] <dergoegge> have you posted the blog post/on reddit yet?
[14:59:18] <adiabat> dergoegge: no I could post it on reddit
[14:59:23] <adiabat> ok maybe kcalvinalvin can?
[14:59:27] <adiabat> *or
[14:59:52] <adiabat> is reddit like you're not supposed to post your own stuff?  or that's not a rule
[15:01:51] <dergoegge> i found a reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hvumoz/utreexo_demo_release_is_here/
[15:02:14] <dergoegge> u/scyshc is calvin i guess?
[15:03:56] <adiabat> I think so
[15:22:13] <kcalvinalvin> yup that's me
[15:24:42] <adiabat> OK hopefully people start writing things there
[15:25:07] <adiabat> good luck on the bitmex interview, hopefully they see some of this :)
