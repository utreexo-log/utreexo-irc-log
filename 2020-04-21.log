[00:26:21] <ja> are the positions always continously populated? if i initially insert 6 elements, i will have indexes 0..5, right? and if i delete leaf 2, will the indexes be 0..4?

[02:24:24] <adiabat> ja: cool will look at PR tomorrow
[02:24:41] <adiabat> yes there are no gaps
[02:25:08] <ja> ah ok. so now i understand why positionMap is not exposed... you should be able to keep track just by counting elements :)
[02:25:24] <adiabat> well, you can't actually..
[02:25:39] <adiabat> it's not exported because the prove functions do it for you
[02:26:12] <ja> oh, so the reason you can't is because you can't know which position an element will assume?
[02:26:30] <adiabat> I mean you can, it's deterministic, but it's complicated
[02:26:51] <adiabat> you basically have to run the remove trasform to figure out where things go
[02:27:13] <ja> yeah, all right
[02:27:32] <ja> currently working on making C bindings...
[02:27:54] <adiabat> and it changes a lot, so it doesn't seem like telling people "your leaf is here at position 572" is that useful, since it will move somehwere else soon
[02:27:56] <adiabat> cool
[02:28:16] <ja> looks like the forest API is pretty stable, so it shouldn't be a big burden
[02:28:46] <adiabat> yeah.  I think kcalvinalvin is changing the names / comments a bit of the forest, but API should stay the same
[12:49:01] <adiabat> Hi- can do weekly jitsi call at 9:30
[12:49:28] <adiabat> or whenever, we can change the day / time for this since "days of the week" don't mean much anymore
[13:08:25] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat Hi I'm available
[13:08:37] <kcalvinalvin> my irc client is dropping messages...
[13:31:51] <adiabat> ok give me a minute...

[15:32:35] <ja> ok i talked to kcalvin and i will remove the new log module in my pr, and have the 'tree' module (formerly 'utreexo') take a single logger which will be used for everything in there. tomorrow i will rebase on top of kcalvin's PR
