[03:20:23] <adiabat> When I merge in the mapless batchproof code I can't get it to work...
[03:42:29] <adiabat> hey dergoegge or kcalvinalvin - could you help check the flatttl branch - there's some interaction with the newer batchproof stuff
[03:42:31] <adiabat> I think
[03:43:23] <adiabat> I didn't change much about the accumulator stuff so it's probably some tiny thing; I changed mainly the serialization of the batchproof but I don't think that broke anything
[03:43:46] <adiabat> what I did change that's maybe conflicting is that the batchProof is now always unsorted
[03:44:17] <adiabat> so bp.Targets is always in block order, not sorted accumulator order
[03:45:30] <adiabat> hm actually I'm pretty sure it's that
[03:45:38] <adiabat> bp gets handed around everywhere
[03:46:07] <adiabat> if something is sorting bp.Targets or doing bp.Targets = bp.Targets[1:] or things like that
[03:46:43] <adiabat> I could instead go to the CSN side and make a deep copy of the AccProof and hand that to the accumulator functions
[03:47:08] <adiabat> might do that for now to merge it, but really that's not a user friendly library
[03:47:40] <adiabat> Because CSNs have to call several accumulator functions in a rom with the same bp
[03:48:09] <adiabat> They call Verify, which calls (bp *BatchProof) Reconstruct()
[03:48:48] <adiabat> Then they call (p *Pollard) IngestBatchProof(), which calls verifyBatchProof() on it
[03:49:24] <adiabat> then they call pollard.Modify() though by then it's basically over, so as long as the targets make it intact to there should be OK
[04:20:18] <adiabat> yeah it's not sorting targets I don't think.... it's something else
[04:20:25] <adiabat> forest and pollard don't agree at all
[04:23:53] <adiabat> I get different swaps for them... even though they're getting the same dels
[04:29:37] <adiabat> ugh never mind
[04:29:55] <adiabat> the internal sorting wasn't in pollard after merge
[04:46:37] <adiabat> anyway it sortof works
[04:46:54] <adiabat> not sure if merge-able but I do really want to merge it because I hate dealing with git
[04:47:23] <adiabat> it usually gets a couple hundred thousand blocks into testnet.  Whcih is pretty good.  Sometimes there's a weird error though where it skips a block
[04:47:31] <adiabat> and that's on the genproofs side it seems
[04:56:00] <adiabat> anyway, kcalvinalvin - if you want to test it beforehand cool but I think I'll merge it tomorrow
[04:56:25] <adiabat> it's not like master works perfectly either; this does seem to introduce a bug but it's a hard one to track down
[05:37:15] <kcalvinalvin> Unit test are broken with 206
[05:39:22] <kcalvinalvin> I'll make a PR to your PR
[05:46:27] <kcalvinalvin> Ok it's def faster haha
[07:07:00] <kcalvinalvin> I've made a comment. ud.Deserialize() is broken so the server doesn't work

[14:22:06] <adiabat> oh man!  forgetting a & ...!
[14:22:30] <adiabat> riiight usually it complains but since it was a slice element it wouldn't there
[14:23:33] <adiabat> I don't get it though; how would that result in an error that turns up randomly a few times per million blocks...?
[14:31:46] <dergoegge> yeah that i dont understand either but for me it happened everytime i started serving...

[15:13:47] <kcalvinalvin> You guys can serve? It crashes for me
[15:58:29] <adiabat> what does the error say?
[15:59:03] <adiabat> my setup is run ./utreexoserver, then ctrl-c, then ./utreexoserver -serve
[16:14:08] <kcalvinalvin> https://github.com/kcalvinalvin/utreexo/runs/1325060531
[16:14:12] <kcalvinalvin> same as this CI error
[16:16:40] <adiabat> hm EOF
[16:16:54] <adiabat> I took an EOF check out yesterday
[16:21:45] <kcalvinalvin> :/ no squashing of the commits? Or can you do that during the merge?
[16:21:54] <adiabat> I'm going to squash
[16:22:00] <kcalvinalvin> :)
[16:22:00] <adiabat> one I get it working
[16:22:03] <adiabat> *once
[16:22:13] <adiabat> on my machine it works fine
[16:22:17] <kcalvinalvin> huh
[16:22:31] <kcalvinalvin> odd
[16:23:49] <adiabat> ohhhhh
[16:23:52] <adiabat> psh stupid error
[16:25:54] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: have you tried testing it with a larger block set?
[16:26:15] <adiabat> I ran it 2 times on testnet up to like 500K blocks and it looks like it works
[16:26:16] <kcalvinalvin> as in closer to the tip?
[16:26:26] <kcalvinalvin> ok I'll try the latest right now
[16:26:34] <adiabat> Yesterday it would sometimes get that far, but sometimes not
[16:26:43] <adiabat> I guess it was just the missing &
[16:27:29] <adiabat> but also that seems like it can't be it, how could that only cause problems once in a million blocks...
[16:28:11] <adiabat> but, it did seem to fix it, and tests pass, and running through testnet seems to work OK so...
[16:28:21] <adiabat> guess I'll squash & merge
[16:28:36] <adiabat> there might still be bugs, but that's the case with any big change
[16:28:36] <kcalvinalvin> 5 minutes?
[16:28:48] <kcalvinalvin> Am at ~200,000 on testnet
[16:28:48] <adiabat> what about 5 minutes?
[16:29:23] <kcalvinalvin> Ah I'm just testing it out. If we wait 5 mins we could see if it works past 500,000
[16:29:27] <adiabat> sure
[16:29:33] <adiabat> no rush
[16:29:40] <adiabat> well I do want to merge it today at some point
[16:29:49] <adiabat> then probably can't work on utreexo till next week
[16:30:11] <adiabat> well maybe a little tomorrow
[16:31:10] <kcalvinalvin> Yeah no today sounds great. I've started working on bringing more btcd code in
[16:31:20] <kcalvinalvin> Would be less hassle to rebase now :)
[16:31:24] <adiabat> yeah
[16:31:33] <adiabat> on mine I have ~30% cpu for the server
[16:31:40] <adiabat> which still seems higher than it should be
[16:31:51] <kcalvinalvin> Around the same for me as well
[16:31:59] <kcalvinalvin> 30% on all cores
[16:32:20] <adiabat> ohhh it's still doing the deserialize oops
[16:33:12] <kcalvinalvin> Also, should I just dump stuff on the rustreexo repo
[16:33:27] <kcalvinalvin> deletions are hard and I think it'll take a while
[16:33:33] <adiabat> ok yup down to 10% cpu
[16:33:53] <adiabat> I bet it could get even lower but... that's fine
[16:34:05] <kcalvinalvin> Maybe the ilbutreexo stuff should be on the dci repo as well...
[16:35:11] <adiabat> hmm yeah once blocks are a bit larger and it's not seeking as much, server goes down to 3% CPU, client staying up at ~150%
[16:36:05] <adiabat> so there's certainly room for parallel stuff on the client side as it's not bottlenecked by the server at all
[16:36:43] <adiabat> the the latest commit if you want, it's got most of the silly not-actual-testing stuff taken out
