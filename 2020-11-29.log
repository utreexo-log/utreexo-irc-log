[18:17:24] <ja> kcalvinalvin: trying to read your transformreadme.md, but i don't even know which leaves the example talks about deleting
[18:18:10] <ja> it just starts out saying that when rowTrans is on row 02, 06 will be deleted. but surely the input to this whole process is a list of leaves to delete?
[18:19:28] <ja> then at the end it says "add example tree deletion". what is tree deletion even? i thought only leaves are deleted?
