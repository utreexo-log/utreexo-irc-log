[05:26:20] <kcalvinalvnn> Heya. I'm going through the utreexo lib now.
[05:26:31] <kcalvinalvnn> https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/pull/32 would be good to go over tonight
[13:41:08] <adiabat> hey - sorry just saw this in morning
[13:41:43] <adiabat> I'm heading to work now & it's snowing a lot so could be late... hmm maybe I should just do the call from here...
[13:42:11] <adiabat> but then I'd have to rush to work in the snow or be late for the next thing... so... can do the call but probably 9:15 ish
[13:51:18] <kcalvinalvnn> ok I'm fine with either
[14:09:56] <adiabat> ok online now
[14:10:00] <kcalvinalvnn> one sec
