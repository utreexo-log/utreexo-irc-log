[07:49:55] <kcalvinalvnn> ok so log is still gigabytes...
[07:50:08] <kcalvinalvnn> it seems to be faster though...?
[15:05:16] <adiabat> kcalvinalvnn: yup forgot 2 prinfs in a different file argh
[15:05:23] <adiabat> will push the version that works
[15:10:31] <adiabat> ok pushed, yeah now it gets to block 200K in about a minute
[15:12:29] <adiabat> and the log file is like a megabyte.
[15:12:52] <adiabat> There are definitely speedups / improvements left, but not 1000X ones like removing printfs :)
[17:03:39] <adiabat> yeah I got just under an hour for all of testnet buildproof (to block 1513500)
[17:04:01] <adiabat> proofdb folder for testnet is 5.4GB
[17:05:38] <adiabat> so a bunch less than the block data wich is 21GB.  I thought it was worse than that, not sure if that's just a testnet thing
