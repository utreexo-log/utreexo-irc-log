[02:28:03] <vertion> Haha, yeah.  I never got the utree/ subfolder.  I'll check out the updated readme!

[05:35:56] <mdrollette> interestingly, I plugged in a different disk and ran the same command, but with `-inram` this time, and this disk also seems to have been corrupted after some time. different I/O errors and write failures from the first disk though.

[12:33:59] <dergoegge> mdrollette: hm that is interesting, i suspect the writes fail somewhere in here: https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/blob/1ec540cc5d08692eded88673635dee96aecbd8c7/bridgenode/offsetfile.go#L142 could you publish the`utreexoserver` output?

[12:36:08] <dergoegge> you mentioned the first disk is old, is the second one also old? as far as i know we did not encounter anything like this before. could the disks be broken?

[15:47:00] <ja> dergoegge: they are definitely broken, mdrollette started out saying that and how else would you explain all the error messages in dmesg?
[15:47:39] <mdrollette> They are both older disks, it definitely could be coincidence. I've synced bitcoin and electrumx on them in the past, so was surprised to see them both fail now.
[15:47:39] <ja> mdrollette: maybe it is actually your disk controller??
