[14:18:19] <adiabat> dergoegge: Swaps could be 1-way moves except then it's not reversible for undo.  But in lots of cases yeah we don't need to write the left value back since it gets chopped off anyway
[14:19:06] <adiabat> so that could be an optimization, where if we know we're writing to a place that's past the right border of the nextNumLeaves
[14:19:45] <adiabat> then don't bother writing it.  Not sure how much of a speedup that will give, but may help and should be doable
[14:19:49] <adiabat> fanquake: heh :)
