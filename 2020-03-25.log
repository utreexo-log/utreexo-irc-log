[01:34:46] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: i also did the challenge, did you get the one about choosing transactions for a block?
[01:35:10] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: i am unhappy with my solution because i could have made it choose high-fee transaction closures with just a few lines more, but didn't think of it
[01:35:48] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: and i thought i could throw a knapsack solver at it, but then all the knapsack solvers i tried could handle only toy examples
