[04:29:54] <adiabat> how do we get rid of dbworker?
[04:31:03] <adiabat> like, it's dumb because it's only storing this tuny 4 byte value, but if we don't have it...
[04:31:20] <adiabat> then we'd have to search through every tx in the block every time we want to write a ttl
[04:33:44] <adiabat> 3GB for posmap is ... bad but ... oh I *do* have another way to do it more efficiently
[04:34:07] <adiabat> but... that's some whole other fun thing to code which... yeah maybe better not to get into now
[04:35:04] <adiabat> maybe dbWorker can be more efficient if we have a cache in front of it...?
[04:35:38] <adiabat> it seems a little crazy since the whole point of the dbWorker is ultimately to get TTL values to cache better
[04:36:22] <adiabat> but we could keep a 10 block or so map of outpoint : positionInBlock
[04:36:44] <adiabat> and then only write to the DB the entries that are still around after 10 blocks and flush them from the map then
[04:37:00] <adiabat> (if they haven't been removed from the map by getting spent first)
[04:37:23] <adiabat> would cut down db writes by half or so, and doesn't take much ram
[04:37:46] <adiabat> of course, this server isn't really as important because the btcd stuff will be what everyone uses
[07:27:37] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat We should also start talking about long term goals (at least for this year)
[07:28:15] <kcalvinalvin> I'm thinking we should start focusing more on the actual library more and port those to C++ (and maybe Rust)
[07:29:13] <kcalvinalvin> I have a lot of doubts about btcd merge happening in a reasonable time-frame
[07:29:32] <kcalvinalvin> In contrast, Bitcoin Core and rust-bitcoin are at least active
