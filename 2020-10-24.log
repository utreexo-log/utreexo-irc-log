[14:06:12] <dergoegge> turns out the Sum512_256 checksum that go computes is not the same as the first 32 bytes of a normal sha512. 
[14:06:37] <dergoegge> taking the first 32 bytes would be safe though right?
[14:06:46] <dergoegge> why do they make it this complicated
[14:08:47] <dergoegge> they use different init values for the different checksum sizes: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/sha512/sha512.go#L45
[14:09:16] <dergoegge> but still copy the first 32 bytes: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/9ec0a46a15d98db9241bca7606bb0a90a3c77b01/src/crypto/sha512/sha512.go#L365
[14:09:21] <ja> they also have different padding according to https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/31422/12089
