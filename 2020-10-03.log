[02:09:08] <adiabat> hey, I think kcalvinalvin you said you would try to split up the proof file - hold off on that for this weekend
[02:09:24] <adiabat> I should be able to merge #206, then it will be easier to split up the flat files
[02:10:11] <adiabat> #206 moves lots of things around in the bridgenode package so it will be a pain to rebase or merge if you start on current master & I merge #206
