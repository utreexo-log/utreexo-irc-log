[10:34:55] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat So the direction is to have the accumulator/ directory as a pure accumulator right?
[10:35:42] <kcalvinalvin> I'm moving stuff around since right now imports to btcd is kinda difficult. I guess I'll make a new directory for all the bitcoin specific stuff?

[14:51:38] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: yeah I think there is nothing bitcoin specific in the accumulator folder now
[14:52:25] <adiabat> we sortof have it set up right with bridgenode / csn / util folders
[14:52:51] <adiabat> maybe we don't have to call it "bridgenode" and can just call that stuff bridge
[14:53:09] <adiabat> but keeping it separate that way and having btcd import from there could work
[17:18:15] <rjected> kcalvinalvin: cool stuff with the benchmarks and speed improvements, I saw #182 and thought u should take a look at benchstat, it helps get statistics for how much faster something is
[17:19:07] <rjected> makes it really easy to get number for "this thing is x% faster"
