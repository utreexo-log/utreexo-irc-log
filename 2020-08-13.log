[11:32:52] <dergoegge> i am pretty sure i did the ttl thing wrong. it currently sends the ttls of the inputs/targets but it needs to send the ttls of the outputs/new leaves. i think i was confused because the udata struct has the UtxoData slice which is the txo data for the inputs not the outputs. i will make a pr later today to fix this.

[15:55:39] <dergoegge> #184 should fix it
[15:56:30] <dergoegge> adiabat: or you do this with the PR that moves the ttls to flat files, i don't know how far you have gotten with that
[18:20:39] <ja> i was told after my talk that utreexo that it is similar to bamboo: https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/bamboo , but it's hard to me to translate all the concepts
[18:20:44] <ja> but i thought i'd drop that link in here
