[03:54:18] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat. On the PR #102, we're still hashing before inputting into the tree.
[03:55:24] <kcalvinalvin> The hash *is* a big bottle neck at the moment. Would having a compressed PKS work vs hashing the data?
[03:55:58] <kcalvinalvin> AMT could also be compressed like how core does it right now
[04:05:15] <kcalvinalvin> Also go test is failing..? Is it using the same tree for the different tests?
[04:38:20] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: it is running "go test -v ./utreexo" in CI, maybe that explains it?
[04:38:59] <kcalvinalvin> oh right -v broke some backwards compatibility right
[04:41:43] <ysangkok> i don't think the -v makes any difference? that is just verbosity

[14:15:53] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: what do you mean by "the hash is a big bottleneck"?
[14:15:55] <adiabat> which hash?
[14:16:20] <adiabat> yeah not sure about test failing since all I did so far was add the readme huh
[14:18:20] <adiabat> by compressed PKS, if you mean something like:
[14:18:52] <adiabat> right now, leafhash is h(BH, OP, CH, AMT, PKS)
[14:19:14] <adiabat> instead make it h(BH, OP, CH, AMT, TPKS), using the tagged format in posdata
[14:20:00] <adiabat> hm.  doubt it makes a huge difference speed wise?  But the question is is that safe... hmm
[14:20:49] <adiabat> I think it's safe to do that because you still have the TXID going in, via OP, which really covers everything...
[14:20:55] <adiabat> but... no...
[14:21:12] <adiabat> no maybe it's not safe to do that.
[14:22:36] <adiabat> anyway I don't even know if that's what you're proposing.  But I think you have to put the whole pubkey script into the leaf hash.
[14:22:58] <adiabat> either that or give the whole previous transaction as part of the proof so they can check that the txid matches

[18:35:51] <ysangkok> go test also fails when i run it locally on master. it has nothing to do with that PR, i think
