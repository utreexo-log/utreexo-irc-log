[02:56:35] <adiabat> fogof: yes, large / high up swaps are costly for the forest-on-disk implementaion, which has everything written in-order
[02:56:57] <adiabat> there are other representations that use pointers that don't have this problem, but those can have other trade-offs
[02:57:59] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin got some data on the distributuion of swaps here: https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/issues/202
[03:04:49] <adiabat> the distribution looks like 2^-x or so, which makes sense
[03:05:14] <adiabat> so my guess is it's not actually that costly since the large ones don't happen very often.
[03:06:14] <adiabat> But that's most of a guess; we don't yet have great data about which parts are slowing things down.  If the large swaps are a bottleneck we can use other designs to avoid the disk read/write
[03:20:09] <kcalvinalvin> fwiw the cowForest thing doesn't do the whole schooching thing
[03:20:43] <kcalvinalvin> The name sucks though because it's really a redirect-on-write but rowForest makes everything more confusing
[03:22:44] <adiabat> haha "rowForest" would be great.  could just call it height forest instead :)
[03:23:37] <kcalvinalvin> I wish I gave better names to things
[03:35:04] <adiabat> yeah names are annoying
[03:35:18] <adiabat> almost as annoying as getting structs from one computer to another...
[04:49:29] <adiabat> ... well the client gets to height 429 now.  So that's better than the 381 it was stuck on
[07:49:47] <kcalvinalvin> 492 is an odd number
[07:50:46] <kcalvinalvin> Lol 381 is special because it's the first block in testnet3 with a spend
[07:51:23] <kcalvinalvin> 383 is the first with multiple spends

[14:22:55] <adiabat> 429 probably has some other "first", like first 0-duration spend
[14:23:06] <adiabat> no that's 383 actually
[14:23:27] <adiabat> i'm sure 429 has a first something, if I see what it is that will lead to the bug
