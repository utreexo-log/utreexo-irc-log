[03:22:18] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat I commented on the commit that you did but yeah I did have the printf commented out already :)
[03:22:32] <kcalvinalvin> It's even slower with the printf

[18:51:46] <adiabat> oh you already got rid of it heh.  OK wellll... hm.  Not faster at all then.
[18:52:18] <adiabat> probably not worth doing pprofs ... but I have a decent idea that the positionMap swapping is slowing it down
[18:52:46] <adiabat> it's got a good amount of redundancy and could be improved, maybe using some of the undo code...
[18:53:27] <adiabat> but really, I think everything's fast enough for now; you can always try to make things faster / more efficient but it's pretty good, can work on getting it plugged in and usable
