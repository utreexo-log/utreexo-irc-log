[12:56:07] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: ok -- I can do a jitsi call now or whenever really
[12:56:16] <kcalvinalvin> ok cool
[12:56:25] <kcalvinalvin> Sigh just finished chaincode challenge
[12:56:27] <adiabat> (well, have calls from 10:20 to 12:00 but other than that)
[12:56:44] <adiabat> chaincode challenge?  they have like an interview test thing?
[12:59:36] <kcalvinalvin> yes
[12:59:48] <kcalvinalvin> 3 hour timed challenge (basically coding interview)
[12:59:58] <adiabat> yikes timed
[13:00:27] <kcalvinalvin> yeah... I'm not happy with my results :/
[13:00:51] <adiabat> hm.  hopefully they don't weight the timed coding thing too much
[13:01:03] <adiabat> I probably wouldn't do well on one of those
[13:01:14] <kcalvinalvin> Ok so I'll get on call in 30 min
[13:01:18] <adiabat> I don't think I've ever taken one... can you still use your same IDE and stuff?
[13:01:23] <adiabat> OK will do call in 30m
[13:01:29] <kcalvinalvin> I... only ever used neovim and tmux
[13:01:40] <adiabat> if I had to code in a different language / IDE / setup that'd be hard
