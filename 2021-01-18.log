[13:06:08] <adiabat> hey want to skip today's meeting and do one later in the week?  I haven't done much since the last call a few days ago, and it's a holiday in the USA today
[13:06:20] <adiabat> so another call like wed/ thurs would work

[13:24:04] <dergoegge> Only wednesday would work for me
[13:25:05] <adiabat> ok; can also do later in the day; claire is in California .... but then that conflicts with calvin I guess
[13:27:26] <dergoegge> I could also do friday. Or later today but yea thats not great for calvin
[13:29:41] <dergoegge> Im also fine with skipping today, havent done much since the last call
[13:39:34] <kcalvinalvin> I've done a bit heh. I can do a short one or later in the week

[14:01:01] <adiabat> we could talk now if you want
[14:01:07] <adiabat> maybe shorter as I don't have anything
[14:01:42] <kcalvinalvin> ok I'll get on jitsi
[17:21:09] <kcalvinalvin> I have it now so that CSNs ignore all nodes that aren't bridgenodes
[17:21:32] <kcalvinalvin> We still want bridgenodes to be connected to non utreexo nodes right? Still needs to keep up with the chain
[17:21:53] <kcalvinalvin> Like, all the normal node functionality is still there as well
[17:56:42] <dergoegge> bridges should and can do everything normal full nodes do. i think for now its ok if the csns only connect to bridges (for the demo at least)
[18:39:55] <adiabat> yeah for now bridgenodes can connect around.  Wondering if they should advertise being a bridge node or not
[18:40:06] <adiabat> maybe they should only respond "I'm a bridge" if a CSN asks
[18:40:26] <adiabat> and if they connect out, they just say they're a regular node
[18:40:58] <adiabat> so the CSN will be the one connecting to nodes, asking if they're bridge (or rather, utreexo compatible) and then disconnecting if they're not
[18:41:22] <adiabat> right now I guess CSN will just connect to a signle bridge
[18:41:53] <adiabat> evnetually CSNs could connect to each other, and won't be able to know who's a bridge and who's a CSN I guess.  That's a ways off though
