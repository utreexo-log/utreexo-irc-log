[14:59:34] <dergoegge> kcalvinalvin: reMap is not needed for the cow forest, right? or am i missing something. i think the reMap just does nothing here because all the hashes should stay in the same tree blocks.

[16:34:41] <kcalvinalvin> dergoegge not directly. It can work without it (you'd just have to allocate a new treeTable whenever needed) but I made new treeTable allocations only during a reMap to fit with the current interface/behavior
[16:35:13] <kcalvinalvin> treeBlocks within the treeTable are nil until they are needed
