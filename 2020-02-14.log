[02:58:55] <kcalvinalvin> fanquake Only go for the moment
[03:00:21] <kcalvinalvin> There *are* other implementations but those are all outdated
[03:00:37] <kcalvinalvin> And I non are in C

[06:59:00] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat remember when you said writing the validate block is exactly like libconsensus
[06:59:10] <kcalvinalvin> It's feeling like that heh...
[13:23:38] <adiabat> fanquake: cfields_ made a c++ framework for it, at some point I should start porting things over, as most of the accumulator library is pretty stable now
[13:26:43] <fanquake> adiabat: ok. I think the c++ lib is mostly stubbed out at the moment. Will just look at the go
[14:16:59] <adiabat> fanquake: yeah if you have parts there that don't make sense (probably plenty) let me know a function or line number & I'll add comments
