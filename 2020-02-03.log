[16:38:13] <adiabat> about leaf nodes pointing to themselves:
[16:38:27] <adiabat> a hack / Featureâ„¢
[16:38:45] <adiabat> it's like, I want to have a flag bit for "memorable" so really polNode could have a "memorable bool"
[16:39:06] <adiabat> but that one bool actually makes the node like 8 bytes bigger, which is signifcant
[16:39:27] <adiabat> also, the big problem is all the leaves, which is 50% of the nodes, have two pointers which do nothing
[16:39:36] <adiabat> (since they have no children / nieces)
[16:40:03] <adiabat> I tried making polNode an interface, and then there could be 2 types: leafNodes and intermediateNodes
[16:40:26] <adiabat> but the way (in go at least) interfaces work is that there's a pointer to the struct, and then a pointer to the interface
[16:40:42] <adiabat> so you save 2 pointers on the leaves, but add 1 pointer to every node
[16:41:05] <adiabat> - 16 bytes on 50% of nodes, and +8 bytes on 100% of nodes, so that gets no savings
[16:41:29] <adiabat> (and also makes the code a bit more complex than having dead end / nil pointers at the bottom)
[16:42:05] <adiabat> so another idea was, hey there's all this empty pointer data on the leaves, 16 bytes, each, why not put hash data in there
[16:42:49] <adiabat> which is all like, unsafe package / pointer arithmetic, a field that's a "pointer" but half the time it's actually not
[16:43:23] <adiabat> so... I haven't done that.  But... yeah it's defintely an inefficiency in pollard / polNode
[16:44:40] <adiabat> so right now 1/6th of the space in the pollard forest structure is nil pointers
[16:44:52] <adiabat> but haven't found a nice clean way to avoid that
