[14:33:57] <adiabat> hey - a tmux session sounds cool. can we go through btcd stuff to get a broad view of it, what connects to what, etc?
[14:34:12] <adiabat> or can do that another time if you have a different plan for tomorrow
[14:35:10] <adiabat> I should be online at 9am as normal, I'll go to the voting at 7am and I don't think there will be a long line, but hard to know for sure
[14:35:43] <adiabat> also europe and north america are now both on "standard" time
[14:36:33] <adiabat> (I think standard time is now only about 4 or 5 months of the year so somewhat non-standard :)
