[11:22:13] <kcalvinalvin> some profiling the client still tells me that the server isn't serving fast enough
[11:22:26] <kcalvinalvin> Much much better though heh

[13:07:25] <kcalvinalvin> I just ended up dumping whatever I had to the rustreexo repo
[16:45:13] <adiabat> the server is still CPU limited, or disk limited?
[16:45:34] <adiabat> if the server is limited by disk reads and sending it over the network, that's actually great
[16:46:03] <adiabat> that means the bottleneck of the whole client / server chain is that we just can't get block and proof data off of the disk fast enough
[16:46:27] <adiabat> there are definitely ways to improve that a bit
[16:46:47] <adiabat> we're opening and closing the proof file every time we do a read instead of keeping it open, that's easy to fix
[16:46:58] <adiabat> a little fancier would be to pre-fetch
[19:30:44] <ja> adiabat: why is it bad to have one giant file? then you can mmap it and easily advice linux when you're likely to continue reading
