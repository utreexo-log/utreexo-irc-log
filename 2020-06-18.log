[14:22:26] <dergoegge> adiabat: i started working getting the integration test to run on github actions. But there was an error and now the job will run until job time limit is reached.
[14:23:01] <dergoegge> can you kill that job for me?
[14:24:24] <dergoegge> https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/actions/runs/139742377
[14:25:48] <dergoegge> i will put a limit in the script, so this doesn't happen again. maybe you can also reduce the default job time limit?
[15:09:05] <adiabat> dergoegge: I clicked cancel workflow
[15:09:09] <adiabat> I think that cancelled it
[15:10:00] <adiabat> do you know where I can change the time limit..?
[15:14:06] <adiabat> seems like there's only a per-job setting, not a global / default (or I can't find it)

[15:46:07] <dergoegge> i have no experience with actions so i dont know if there is a global setting. but the per job limit seems good enough
