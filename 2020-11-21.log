[07:54:19] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm you would have to first sync to the tip to start generating proofs right? (if you're a bridgenode)

[13:22:09] <dergoegge> In general or with the current codebase?
[13:22:39] *** belcher_ is now known as belcher
[16:55:58] <kcalvinalvin> dergoegge in general
[16:56:40] <kcalvinalvin> I guess you can start generating proofs if you ignore the ttls
[16:56:54] <kcalvinalvin> But then you'd have to re-do the ttls once you're at the tip
[20:54:21] <dergoegge> maybe i dont understand what you mean but currently we just initialise the ttls for a block with zero in the flatfile and later go back and update them if we see the output being spend. thats what #206 was about. i dont see why this wouldnt work in btcd or bitcoind during IBD
