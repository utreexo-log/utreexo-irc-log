[07:30:21] <kcalvinalvin> doing locality plotting
[07:30:26] <kcalvinalvin> Doesn't look good...
[07:30:58] <kcalvinalvin> My laptop is too slow to do higher up blocks but the very right of the forest is getting accessed a lot
[13:36:31] <dergoegge> maybe it makes sense to plot the positions as targetpos/numLeaves? then the distributions for the older blocks dont vanish as you plot more blocks
[13:37:44] <dergoegge> the gaps also seem interesting
[13:39:26] <dergoegge> block 150k was around ~2011, maybe more recent blocks have better locality?
[14:43:47] <adiabat> "the very right of the forest is getting accessed a lot           
[14:43:58] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: but that sounds good!
[14:44:36] <adiabat> we want all the access on the right, that's where the trees are shortest & cluster together...
