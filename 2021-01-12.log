[04:51:44] <kcalvinalvin> Ok I benchmarked btcd with the IsUnspendable in the utreexo repo.
[04:51:59] <kcalvinalvin> It's *slightly* faster
[04:54:25] <kcalvinalvin> I both ran them for 2 hours and profiled them. The one with the utreexo repo's IsUnspendable got to ~293,000 and btcd master got to ~292,000

[16:08:10] <dergoegge> Hm thats pretty minimal. I assume this is on mainnet? Maybe there is a bigger difference for the blocks 300k-600k since they are mostly full
[17:04:59] <kcalvinalvin> yeah this was on mainnet
[17:06:04] <kcalvinalvin> Maybe? But in general, the time taken up by IsUnspendable is small according to pprof so I don't think it'd make a huge difference
