[22:35:13] <adiabat> Hey all - the plan is to go back to 09:30 EDT for tomorrows call, and then switch back and forth between the two times
[22:36:20] <adiabat> I don't think there's any time that works for everyone so this seems ... an OK compromise? 
[22:37:56] <adiabat> The downside is that people in PDT don't get to talk to people in AWST
[22:38:31] <adiabat> for that I guess we'd have to do a evening EDT time, but then for people in europe that's like the middle of the night/ early morning
[22:38:49] <adiabat> which... I'm also fine with doing.  Maybe it's getting a bit complicated though heh
