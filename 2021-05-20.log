[16:02:05] <adiabat_> yeah I don't know what that whole thing is about
[16:02:18] <adiabat_> like is the freenode server going down?
[16:02:38] <adiabat_> or just... owned by bad guys or something?  It's not like we trust the server
[16:03:27] <adiabat_> I figure whatever #bitcoin-dev and the like do this channel will follow
