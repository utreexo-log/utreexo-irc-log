[08:47:29] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat You said btcd storage was a bit bigger right?
[08:48:33] <kcalvinalvin> I'm looking at why btcd is taking so long with the database operations and part of it is how they handle reorgs. They just throw everything into the database
[08:49:44] <kcalvinalvin> maybe this method uses up more space as well?

[17:30:33] <ja> kcalvinalvin: what is the alternative to "throwing everything into the database"?
