[18:53:16] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat Did you start working on the rev block check thingy?
[18:53:31] <kcalvinalvin> I may give a go at reading the index/ directory
[18:53:42] <kcalvinalvin> Doesn't seem *that* hard
[18:58:32] <ThomasV> hi, is there a workaround for #130?
[18:59:57] <kcalvinalvin> ThomasV for the moment, no. But a fix is coming soon...
[19:01:10] <ThomasV> kcalvinalvin: thanks. also, is there a document specifying how you build the root hashes?
[19:03:03] <kcalvinalvin> I assume you're talking about CSN nodes. All you do is call Modify() method for Pollard and it generates it by itself
[19:04:00] <kcalvinalvin> Same for bridgenode as well. There's a Modify() method for ```type Forest```
[19:04:49] <kcalvinalvin> https://github.com/mit-dci/utreexo/blob/8c6bca077f9119f838a4fc7f21082eedd0606f55/accumulator/pollard.go#L9 < the code for modifying CSN root hashes
[19:05:03] <ThomasV> I mean a specification of what the code does
[19:05:35] <ThomasV> ok thanks
[19:06:05] <kcalvinalvin> Well, yeah there isn't really any good spec of what the code does yet
[19:06:14] <kcalvinalvin> We should put that on the TODO list
[19:07:28] <ThomasV> maybe write a BIP :-)

[19:14:18] <kcalvinalvin> That's in the works :) Just need to get the actual mempool implementation done
[19:17:00] <ThomasV> what needs to be done in relation to mempool?
[19:30:55] <rjected> there's a todo list? or is it just the set of all todo's in the repo
[19:31:45] <rjected> oh i found the projects page nvm

[22:48:41] <adiabat> kcalvinalvinL haven't started the rev shuffler, I agree it doesn't sound too hard as it's pretty similar to the blk shuffler
[22:49:23] <adiabat> ThomasV: hopefully #130 will be fixed (99% fixed) in a day or two, this is the rev block check issue
[22:50:14] <adiabat> also I should write more of a spec... there is a paper but it's almost a year old ... I'd say everything in the paper is still true
[22:50:47] <adiabat> but there are other things the paper didn't describe in the code; maybe I should update the paper too

[23:02:09] <adiabat> rjected: yeah there's projects on github but that should also be updated.  Some things are pretty much done, which is great...
[23:02:44] <adiabat> and then there's new stuff to do, but really it's like, what should we do next... try to improve ibdsim and stick a wallet on it?
[23:02:54] <adiabat> merge the utreexo sync into btcd?
[23:02:58] <adiabat> get it into core...?
[23:04:11] <adiabat> I guess first get ibdsim working well, to the point where people can reliably download / build / run it and it works
[23:37:45] <ja> i think it is way to early to try to do anything with core given how conservative it is
[23:38:12] <ja> i was thinking maybe i'd be better to have two BIPs? one with the algortihmic foundations, and one with the application in bitcoin
[23:38:22] <ja> like the schnorr BIPs
[23:39:02] <ja> the first bip would contain stuff like updateDirt ;)
