[01:19:30] <kcalvinalvin> ja it's a btcd fork of csn syncing through our server that's modified to talk btcd stuff
[01:19:59] <kcalvinalvin> the best block that you see is through the btcd rpc talking to the csn

[07:40:04] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat so right now, the changed repos are btcd and btcutil
[07:40:21] <kcalvinalvin> I think it'd be better if there were repos for those
[12:50:11] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm what are the chances that the btcd guys accept a PR for the csn if I clean it up
[14:59:40] <dergoegge> right now? i think pretty low, there are no bridge nodes and without pruning its not really use full.
[15:02:30] <dergoegge> genproofs failed on the test server again. i tried inram this time. there is no error message it literally just says "Killed".
[15:03:35] <dergoegge> ugh it did not write the cpu profile to disk
[15:04:00] <dergoegge> i will try again on latest master with cow
[15:04:45] <dergoegge> i am guessing it ran out of memory this time. but its only at height 370k and the server has 16GB hmm...
[15:52:04] <adiabat> dergoegge: huh... maybe a memory leak...? 16GB seems like it should be enough
