[04:45:58] <kcalvinalvin> Is today earlier or later?
[04:46:08] <kcalvinalvin> for the call
[09:37:07] <dergoegge> Today should be the later one
[11:52:41] <adiabat> yeah later today, can do 11:30 if that works
[11:53:02] <adiabat> so in 3h35m
[12:02:19] <dergoegge> 11:30 works for me
[15:32:14] <adiabat> (will be there in a min...)
[15:32:22] <adiabat> (still in different meeting)
[16:17:53] <ja> oh , you finished quickly today
[19:46:23] <adiabat> yeah, 40min or so
[19:46:35] <adiabat> can do another call if there's things you want to discuss
[19:46:43] <adiabat> or talk about on IRC :)
[19:48:26] <ja> ah it's fine, i am just curious, nothing important. still working on explainer animations, very slowly...
[19:50:10] <adiabat> ok sounds good.  I am going to try to get all the disk reads and writes batched together for each Modify() call
[19:50:39] <adiabat> right now there are thousands of calls to SwapNodes which does a blocking read and then write, so it's really hard on disks, hopefully can make that faster
