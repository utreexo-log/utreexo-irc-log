[08:49:52] <kcalvinalvin> Would it be better to just read straight from leveldb?
[08:50:22] <kcalvinalvin> Everything in cmd/ just feels so... hacky...

[22:35:44] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: *everything* ?? :)
[22:36:13] <adiabat> reading from bitcoind's leveldb would be better; I just thought it might be complex and avoided it
[22:36:26] <adiabat> but maybe the ways around that are more trouble
[22:36:53] <adiabat> if the bitcoind has txindex on, then yeah we could do the whole thing in 1-pass which would be nice
[22:37:29] <adiabat> (whole thing as in build the ttl txos file; building proofs would be another pass)
[22:41:20] <adiabat> if bitcoind doesn't have txindex, there's not going to be much savings.  I don't think there's anyting in the other leveldbs that would help
