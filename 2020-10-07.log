[04:17:57] <adiabat> ok got proof building to work (probably anyway, no bugs yet) so now just have to change server & client side 
[04:18:09] <adiabat> which should be easy

[12:01:47] <kcalvinalvin> So my new beefy computer was able to sync up to tip on mainnet in a couple of hours. ttldb is 60GB, proofdata is 451GB, the forest is 8.1GB
[12:02:34] <kcalvinalvin> hmmm now I really wanna work on the "save proof only for odd blocks" thingy...

[15:44:47] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: wait so this is utreexo current master?  huh
[15:45:10] <adiabat> so really the only problem was the disk i/o... and google servers have horrible disks
[15:46:14] <adiabat> so could just have forest in ram and probably keep ttl db in ram, then don't need disk io / ssd... but need 16GB or 32GB of ram
[16:01:36] <dergoegge> i actually ran into some trouble but i was using an external ssd so maybe thats why
[16:01:47] <dergoegge> when quiting it reached the 60sec timeout
[16:02:51] <dergoegge> i have a pprof trace, i will add a comment to #207
[16:03:21] <dergoegge> there is a lot of time spent on the cow forest commit
[16:05:42] <dergoegge> hm looks like i can't attach the pprof file on a github comment
[16:06:52] <dergoegge> also even with cow it was using ~10GB of ram
[16:10:03] <kcalvinalvin> dergoegge ok some tweaking to do with cow...
[16:10:11] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat yea this is on current master
[16:12:58] <dergoegge> kcalvinalvin: all the commit time comes from flushing the cache, so a different cache strategy should already improve this by a lot. although when quitting you will have to flush it all...
[16:23:24] <kcalvinalvin> ok yeah I'll take a looksie
[16:23:45] <kcalvinalvin> adjusting the treeBlocks and treeTables might also hlep
