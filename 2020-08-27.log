[21:00:46] <dergoegge> there is a paper on a dynamic hash based accumulator from 2008 https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~pcamacho/papers/strongacc08.pdf
[21:00:56] <dergoegge> has anyone seen this?
[21:01:32] <dergoegge> it's kinda cool because they only keep one root and it can also do non-inclusion proofs
[21:05:24] <dergoegge> only skimmed the paper so i can't say if it's better or worse than utreexo but it feels a bit more complex...
[21:05:55] <dergoegge> would non-inclusion proofs even be useful for the utxo set?
[21:34:50] *** reallll is now known as belcher
