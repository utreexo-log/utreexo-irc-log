[00:45:23] <lukechampine> Hi all. I've been working on a "Utreexo-native" blockchain from scratch over the past year, and I'm finally ready to share it with other devs. If you're interested in testing out the node or reviewing the code, email me: luke@sia.tech. Thanks!
[06:15:11] <kcalvinalvin> lukechampine: Is the code going to be open sourced?
[06:32:18] <lukechampine> yes, absolutely
