[06:39:02] <kcalvinalvin> Currently I'm moving a lot of thing around from utreexo/ directory. I'll try to push it before the tuesday's call

[17:43:17] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat I think perhaps using the terminology "row" is better than "height" when referring to the current height of a tree in forest
[17:44:00] <kcalvinalvin> height: 2      06
[17:44:21] <kcalvinalvin> /                |---------\
[17:44:31] <kcalvinalvin> height: 1      04        05
[17:44:40] <kcalvinalvin>                |----\    |---\
[17:44:50] <kcalvinalvin>  height: 0      00---01---02---03
[17:45:36] <kcalvinalvin> Like in this tree. The forest height is 2 but in some of the code in utreexo/ the terminology "fHeight" and "h" is used
[18:34:11] <adiabat> ok, row or rownumber instead of height can work.  Because height is used in the blockchain part as well, so could be confusing
