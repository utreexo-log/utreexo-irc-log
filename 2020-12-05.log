[00:08:23] <ja> adiabat: how did you come up with the node numbering scheme and the remTrans2 algorithm?  i am still trying to grasp how it works
[00:09:25] <ja> the requirement must have been: if you have a forest, and some forest indexes, you should be able to develop remTrans2 :P but surely you developed the numbering scheme in parallel with the algorithm
[00:09:48] <ja> so is it conceivable to have another numbering scheme, that would an analogue remTrans2?
[00:10:00] <ja> *that would allow

[00:12:29] <ja> i keep working through your example from printout.txt line 21, and we talked about deleting leaves 4-9. but what does 4-9 really mean? one reformulation could be "all the leaves that are under node 25 or node 20"
[00:13:42] <ja> another reformulation would be [tree 0, right branch], [tree 1, left branch]
