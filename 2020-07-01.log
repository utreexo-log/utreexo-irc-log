[13:06:09] <dergoegge> for new blocks the CBlockFileInfo is sometimes written to the cache of the /index leveldb, and when we then read the on disk version of /index the CBlockFileInfo for those blocks don't show up.
[13:06:34] <dergoegge> setting -dbcache=0 does not work because there is a min cache size: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e491e556469863d39539a3acc7c80fc929b55f04/src/init.cpp#L1518-L1521
[13:06:43] <dergoegge> i dont know how to get around this
[13:08:41] <dergoegge> is there a way to tell bitcoind to flush those caches? one way would be to restart bitcoind but thats no good in our case.
[13:39:07] <fanquake> dergoegge: I'll have to check tomorrow, but there might be an RPC you can call that'll flush them as a side-effect
