[15:43:09] <adiabat> kcalvinalvin: arg sorry internet died
[15:43:32] <adiabat> seems to be back, was out for a day or so.  also no electricity
[15:44:00] <adiabat> will try to fix tody
[15:44:04] <adiabat> *today
[16:02:08] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat oof is that related with covid? 
[16:06:42] <adiabat> no just wind storm
[17:20:17] <kcalvinalvin> ok so while you can do subpackages in go, it's not idomatic go and is discouraged
[17:23:57] <kcalvinalvin> eh... I guess they don't specify directly so it's fine
[17:41:58] <adiabat> by "subpackage" I just mean a package in a subdirectory though
[17:46:44] <kcalvinalvin> yup I'll just continue on. I should be able to finish by tuesday
[17:50:47] <adiabat> I can't get the error on #114
[17:51:11] <adiabat> when does it happen, in genproofs or in ibdsim?
[18:00:24] <adiabat> I'll try downloading different blk / rev files.  Do you think you can make a test that triggers the same problem?
[18:01:01] <adiabat> or print out some more info about like what block, what transaction, things like that.  I might be something weird
[18:01:24] <adiabat> like... coinbase transaction that goes to unspendable...? or something weird like that
[18:07:25] <adiabat> yeah tried with different testnet blk/rev, can't get it to crash
[18:07:29] <adiabat> will comment on github
