[15:01:17] <adiabat> dergoegge: yeah might need unsafe, which I'd hope to avoid but if it really saves time / memory might have to
[15:01:36] <adiabat> also -- why is github all circles now

[15:04:10] <adiabat> monitors are still rectangles.  even if they were circles... rectangles still pack better in a circle than circles do
[15:04:15] <adiabat> </complaint>
[15:10:15] <rjected> I would definitely try to concretely figure out if there's a time/mem benefit before introducing unsafe, another advertisement for go test -bench from me lol
[15:10:43] <kcalvinalvin> Working on some benchmarking stuff at the moment so seems like I'm doing the right thing
