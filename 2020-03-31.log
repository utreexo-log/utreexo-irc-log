[12:05:46] <adiabat> hi can do a call at 9 or 9:30
[12:35:36] <kcalvinalvin> 9:30 is good
[12:35:42] <kcalvinalvin> not sure if that works for ysangkok
[12:45:35] <adiabat> ok will do 9:30
[17:52:04] <kcalvinalvin> Testing on master is failing again :/
[18:08:23] <adiabat> yeah it's weird
[18:09:46] <adiabat> like... its says fail, but not what fails
[18:13:46] <adiabat> ok think I found it
[18:23:54] <adiabat> ok there fixed it... but it's on the "full pollard" thing which is pointless anyway right?
[18:24:04] <adiabat> so should probably get rid of that since it wasn't any faster...
