[08:06:54] <kcalvinalvin> hmm I'm looking to get rid of all the udata stuff and move everything to be included in the bridgenode package
[08:08:00] <kcalvinalvin> Also maybe `LeafData` could be renamed to `sigValData` or something since LeafData doesn't imply that it's also used for sigvalidation
[08:10:47] <kcalvinalvin> Where should BatchProof go? If we have ttls, the proofs sent to the peers would all differ
[08:11:30] <kcalvinalvin> Receive separately from the msgblock?
[08:13:24] <kcalvinalvin> LeafData is awkward too. Include that in the msgblock?

[16:05:27] <adiabat> what does "sigVal" mean?
[16:05:43] <adiabat> oh signature validation?  It's more than that though
[16:06:41] <adiabat> you need it to compute the leaf hash, as well as to check the signature, and also check the amount, height, other things
[16:07:19] <adiabat> I wouldn't focus on "sig" as that's just one part, and actually if we have the compact leafdata (or whatever to call it) it's not even needed to check signaures
[16:07:26] <adiabat> in that case it's mostly the amount
[16:07:43] <adiabat> agree that in general the names are not great
[16:08:08] <adiabat> Ublock and Udata are... confusing.  Also the "u" I guess stands for utreexo but... eh
[20:29:31] <ja> seems like massachussetts passed that right-to-repair bill :)
