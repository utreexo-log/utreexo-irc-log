[06:05:22] <kcalvinalvin> Ok so I'm taking a step back and looking at the utreexo repo (in like forever)
[06:06:03] <kcalvinalvin> And we don't have a memory leak. It's just that when the block read happens (reading off the blk.dat), there's a ton of memory allocations
[06:06:43] <kcalvinalvin> And those don't get collected right away, so they take up approximately 5GB around height ~433,000
[06:07:15] <kcalvinalvin> If I set the gc to collect often, memory usage stays around 7GB for ramForest for height ~433,000
[06:07:34] <kcalvinalvin> about 4.7GB for forest, about 3GB for posmap
[06:11:25] <kcalvinalvin> Also, we need to get rid of dbWorker. Pprof tells me it allocated 1485GBs on a test I ran for like 15 minutes
