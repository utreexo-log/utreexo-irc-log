[17:21:00] <kcalvinalvin> Basically talked about the things needed to be done
[17:22:02] <kcalvinalvin> It is weekly so there is one in a few hours... unless I misread it while back
[18:01:50] <ysangkok> kcalvinalvin: i had to restart my client, when exactly would that be?
[18:18:07] <kcalvinalvin> Well it was originally 8pm EST, but it probably will be 9pm EST this time around
[18:18:18] <kcalvinalvin> Tadge needs to confirm
[18:26:17] <stevenroose> What is that in UTC? :D
[18:47:17] <instagibbs> EST + 5
[18:47:34] <instagibbs> EDT + 6 (after nov 3 for americans)
[18:47:47] <instagibbs> errr backwards, whatever, right now +5
[19:12:45] <adiabat> hey yeah can do a call at 9pm EDT tonight, so that's in 5h48m or so
[19:13:46] <adiabat> hopefully my internet works OK, has been a little flakey.  If we do it in the morning I can do it at work?  then 10pm KST / JST.
[19:14:22] <adiabat> Oh also EDT changes to EST next week so then it's 14 hours off from KST/JST
