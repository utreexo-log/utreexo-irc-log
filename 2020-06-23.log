[21:05:57] <dergoegge> adiabat: using interface{} would still have the same problem, i think. interface{} is implemented as two pointers, one to type info and one to the value.
[21:08:45] <dergoegge> but i think we could use unsafe.Pointer and store the nieces as uintptr that should work. haven't really used the unsafe package before though
