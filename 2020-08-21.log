[08:15:51] <kcalvinalvin> dergoegge the ones in the accumulator side was a bit harder to get rid of the last time I looked at it. But yeah there should be plenty in the node side of things

[10:36:40] <dergoegge> so i tried out preallocating slices and the biggest improvement was for preallocating polNodes in IngestBatchProof. GC went from 26% to 14% ðŸš€
[10:37:47] <dergoegge> i am probably allocating to much in some cases because i wasn't sure what the upper bound on some of the slices is

[16:31:46] <adiabat> dergoegge: yeah in this case the maps vs slices probably doesn't make a big difference, but it's still nicer to have slices, and more portable to other languages
