[00:09:28] <dergoegge> ja: not an off-by-one but still an easy fix: #129
[00:11:03] <dergoegge> are these testnet issues documented somewhere? 
[01:23:27] <ja> dergoegge: no, but if you try syncing to testnet, it halts somewhere, should be easy to reproduce. but you need the testnet chain of course
[01:32:21] <dergoegge> ja: just ran into that issue. i opened a issue on github #130. is that what other people have been reporting aswell?
[01:33:06] <dergoegge> i had the same issue for the current master and the branch with my fix for dedupeSwapDirt
[01:41:27] <ja> hmm i don't know, because i havn't tried recently. but probably tadge will come on in about 12 hours and he can tell you
[01:41:54] <ja> thanks for the fix!
[03:45:22] <rjected> adiabat: Can you explain to me what you mean by "within its arguments"? Do you just mean the arguments should be modified in dedupeSwapDirt()?
[03:58:58] <rjected> we can for sure do that, but there would be exra elements in `a` if any dedupe actually happened. It would also prevent needing to allocate the `c` array (can just modify `a` itself and return a slice of `a`)
[04:04:57] <rjected> you'd always have to overwrite the first argument with the return value though
[04:05:04] <kcalvinalvin> dergoegge I left a comment on issue #130

[14:37:47] <kcalvinalvin> adiabat does ibdsim work for you at the moment?
[14:38:34] <kcalvinalvin> It just panics that it couldn't connect to 127.0.0.1 on master
[15:07:05] <dergoegge> kcalvinalvin: is there a log from genproofs that says "blockServer accept error: ..."? is 127.0.0.1:8338 still accepting connections? if not i might know what happened
[15:09:47] <kcalvinalvin> Ah I just didn't have genproofs running. Huh that's cool, didn't know networking stuff is almost there
