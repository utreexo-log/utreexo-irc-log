[12:43:03] <kcalvinalvin> I tested our release client on a Samsung S9+ with termux
[12:44:05] <kcalvinalvin> It's around 60% the speed of the Ryzen 3600 desktop 
[12:44:29] <kcalvinalvin> It might be fun to do a second release and show a demo on it with a phone :)
[14:06:27] <adiabat> That's cool... and also shows that it could be much faster if it's not really using the cores of a fast desktop cpu...
